<h1>Skarmory was a very tough Pokemon to place, but I feel as if branching off 
of Aerodactyl made the most sense due to their similar body shapes.</h1>
<h1>The reason I branched Torchic off of Piplup is because of their beak 
shapes. Even though they are drasticly different types, the way the chart is 
fits the best.</h1>
