<h2>Birds</h2>
<h1>When I was making the evolution chart I thought that an important
inclusion would be the various bird pokemon we know of. Although, placing
these bird pokemon turned out to be much harder than I had anticipated.
My main leverage when making this branch was the beak shapes. I though that
maybe the shapes of their beaks would make it easier to find their spots.
Even then, this task was very hard to complete. One major thing some people
might notice is that Torchic branched off of Piplup. But the problem here
is that Torchic is a fire type and Piplup is a water type.
